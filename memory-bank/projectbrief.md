# Project Brief: ClipShare

## Project Overview
ClipShare is a real-time clipboard synchronization application that allows users to share clipboard content across multiple devices seamlessly. The application provides a simple way to synchronize clipboards, making it easier to transfer text between different computers and browsers.

## Core Requirements

1. **Clipboard Synchronization**: 
   - Monitor clipboard changes in browsers
   - Propagate changes to all connected devices in real-time
   - Support bidirectional synchronization (any device can update the clipboard)

2. **Authentication & Security**:
   - Simple session-based authentication with passphrase
   - Content only shared with authorized devices in the same session

3. **User Experience**:
   - Clean, intuitive interface
   - Minimal setup required
   - Clear indication of sync status

4. **Technical Requirements**:
   - Frontend: Browser-based application
   - Backend: Node.js server
   - In-memory storage (no database)
   - Containerized with Docker
   - GitHub integration for source code and packages

## Future Enhancements
Future versions may include:
- Support for additional clipboard content types (images, files, etc.)
- Persistent storage for clipboard history
- End-to-end encryption
- User accounts and persistent sessions
- Mobile application support

## Project Constraints
- Must work across different browsers and operating systems
- Must handle browser security restrictions for clipboard access
- Limited to text content initially
- In-memory storage only (data persists only while server is running)

## Success Criteria
The project will be considered successful if:
- Clipboard content can be synchronized in real-time between multiple devices
- Users can easily create and join sessions
- The application is containerized and deployable via Docker
- Code is available on GitHub with proper documentation
