# Progress: ClipShare

## Project Status
Current project status: **Initial Implementation with Manual Clipboard Operations**

The ClipShare application has been reimplemented with a simplified approach. The system now provides clipboard synchronization across devices using a manual copy/paste model instead of automatic monitoring. This reduces complexity and improves cross-OS compatibility.

## What Works

### Core Functionality
- âœ… Session creation and joining with passphrase authentication
- âœ… Manual clipboard operations (copy, paste, clear)
- âœ… Real-time broadcasting of clipboard changes
- âœ… Text content synchronization
- âœ… Image content synchronization
- âœ… Session status and connection indicators

### Technical Implementation
- âœ… Node.js/Express server implementation
- âœ… WebSocket communication via Socket.IO
- âœ… In-memory session and clipboard storage
- âœ… Client-side clipboard utilities for reading/writing
- âœ… Responsive UI with status indicators
- âœ… Docker containerization
- âœ… GitHub integration with Actions workflow

## What's Left to Build

### Immediate Fixes
- âœ… Standardize localStorage key usage ('clipshare_session')
- âœ… Improve error handling for failed initialization
  - âœ… Add auto-disappearing error messages (5-second timeout)
  - ðŸ”„ Enhance permission request workflow
- âœ… Enhance clipboard content type detection
- âœ… Simplify cross-OS clipboard operations (switch to manual model)

### Features
- ðŸ”„ Clipboard history support
- ðŸ”„ Support for additional clipboard content types
  - âœ… Image support
  - ðŸ”„ File support (partial - improvements needed)
- ðŸ”„ Enhanced security features (end-to-end encryption)
- ðŸ”„ User accounts and persistent sessions (optional)
- ðŸ”„ Mobile application support

### Technical Enhancements
- ðŸ”„ Automated testing suite
- ðŸ”„ Performance optimizations for large content
- ðŸ”„ Enhanced browser compatibility
- ðŸ”„ Offline mode with sync when reconnected
- ðŸ”„ Horizontal scaling support

### Documentation & Maintenance
- ðŸ”„ API documentation for potential integrations
- ðŸ”„ User guide with examples
- ðŸ”„ Contributing guidelines

## Recent Milestones
1. **Initial Repository Setup** - Project structure and dependencies
2. **Server Implementation** - Express server with Socket.IO
3. **Session Management** - Authentication and session handling
4. **Clipboard Sync Engine** - Real-time clipboard synchronization
5. **User Interface** - Clean, responsive UI with status indicators
6. **Docker & CI/CD** - Containerization and GitHub Actions
7. **Documentation** - README and memory bank documents
8. **Stability Rollback (May 1, 2025)** - Reverted to commit db428d57 due to localStorage key inconsistencies breaking functionality
9. **Code Modularization (May 1, 2025)** - Refactored clipboard.js into multiple focused modules
10. **Image Synchronization Fix (May 1, 2025)** - Fixed ping-pong issue with image synchronization between tabs
11. **Manual Clipboard Operations (May 1, 2025)** - Simplified to manual copy/paste model for cross-OS compatibility

## Next Milestone Goals
1. ~~**Fix Authentication Storage**~~ âœ… COMPLETED - Resolved localStorage key inconsistencies
2. ~~**Image Support**~~ âœ… COMPLETED - Implemented with support for cross-OS sharing
3. ~~**Cross-OS Compatibility**~~ âœ… COMPLETED - Simplified to manual operations for better compatibility
4. **Enhanced Browser Support** - Improve compatibility with various browsers
5. **Clipboard History** - Add support for limited clipboard history
6. **Security Enhancements** - Add optional TLS and content encryption

## Known Issues
- ~~**Authentication Key Inconsistency**~~ âœ… FIXED - Standardized on 'clipshare_session' localStorage key
- ~~**Cross-OS Synchronization**~~ âœ… FIXED - Implemented manual copy/paste model
- **Error Handling** - JavaScript errors can occur when initializing components in certain sequences
  - âœ… Improved: Added auto-hiding for all error messages
  - ðŸ”„ Future: Additional error handling for network issues needed
- Clipboard access may be restricted in some browsers without HTTPS
- Lengthy clipboard content may cause performance issues
- No offline support - requires constant connection
- No horizontal scaling support with current in-memory implementation

## Project Decisions Evolution

### Clipboard Operation Approach
- **Initial Plan**: Automatic clipboard monitoring with polling
- **Previous Implementation**: Complex content comparison and OS detection
- **Current Implementation**: Manual copy/paste operations
- **Reasoning**: Simplified architecture, improved cross-OS compatibility, reduced complexity

### Authentication Approach
- **Initial Plan**: Simple username/password
- **Current Implementation**: Session name and passphrase
- **Reasoning**: Reduced complexity, no database requirement, improved usability

### Storage Strategy
- **Initial Plan**: Potential database integration
- **Current Implementation**: In-memory only
- **Reasoning**: Simplified implementation, privacy benefits, meets requirements

### UI Framework
- **Initial Plan**: Potentially use React or Vue
- **Current Implementation**: Vanilla JavaScript
- **Reasoning**: Reduced dependencies, faster initial load, simplified development

### Deployment Approach
- **Initial Plan**: Various options considered
- **Current Implementation**: Docker with GitHub Packages
- **Reasoning**: Simplified deployment, consistent environments, easy updates

### Code Stability Strategy
- **Initial Plan**: Continuous deployment of features
- **Current Implementation**: Focused on stability with established baseline at commit db428d57
- **Reasoning**: Prioritizing stable, functioning application over rapid feature additions
