# Progress: ClipShare

## Project Status
Current project status: **Initial Implementation with Manual Clipboard Operations**

The ClipShare application has been reimplemented with a simplified approach. The system now provides clipboard synchronization across devices using a manual copy/paste model instead of automatic monitoring. This reduces complexity and improves cross-OS compatibility.

## What Works

### Core Functionality
- âœ… Session creation and joining with secure client-side encryption
- âœ… Quorum-based authorization for multiple clients
- âœ… Manual clipboard operations (copy, paste, clear)
- âœ… Real-time broadcasting of clipboard changes
- âœ… Text content synchronization
- âœ… Image content synchronization
- âœ… End-to-end encrypted content transfer
- âœ… Session status and connection indicators
- âœ… Enhanced login UI with authentication status feedback

### Technical Implementation
- âœ… Node.js/Express server implementation
- âœ… WebSocket communication via Socket.IO
- âœ… In-memory session and clipboard storage
- âœ… Client-side clipboard utilities for reading/writing
- âœ… Responsive UI with status indicators
- âœ… Docker containerization
- âœ… GitHub integration with Actions workflow

## What's Left to Build

### Immediate Fixes
- âœ… Standardize localStorage key usage ('clipshare_session')
- âœ… Improve error handling for failed initialization
  - âœ… Add auto-disappearing error messages (5-second timeout)
  - ðŸ”„ Enhance permission request workflow
- âœ… Enhance clipboard content type detection
- âœ… Simplify cross-OS clipboard operations (switch to manual model)

## Project Decisions Evolution

### Clipboard Operation Approach
- **Initial Plan**: Automatic clipboard monitoring with polling
- **Previous Implementation**: Complex content comparison and OS detection
- **Current Implementation**: Manual copy/paste operations
- **Reasoning**: Simplified architecture, improved cross-OS compatibility, reduced complexity

### Authentication Approach
- **Initial Plan**: Simple username/password
- **Previous Implementation**: Session name and passphrase (server-verified)
- **Current Implementation**: Client-side encryption with AES and quorum-based verification
- **Reasoning**: 
  - Enhanced security without server complexity
  - Passphrases never transmitted to server
  - Existing clients verify new ones for additional security
  - Session banning mechanism for potential security breaches
  - Maintains simplicity from user perspective

### Storage Strategy
- **Initial Plan**: Potential database integration
- **Current Implementation**: In-memory only
- **Reasoning**: Simplified implementation, privacy benefits, meets requirements

### UI Framework
- **Initial Plan**: Potentially use React or Vue
- **Current Implementation**: Vanilla JavaScript
- **Reasoning**: Reduced dependencies, faster initial load, simplified development

### Deployment Approach
- **Initial Plan**: Various options considered
- **Current Implementation**: Docker with GitHub Packages
- **Reasoning**: Simplified deployment, consistent environments, easy updates

### Code Stability Strategy
- **Initial Plan**: Continuous deployment of features
- **Current Implementation**: Focused on stability with established baseline at commit db428d57
- **Reasoning**: Prioritizing stable, functioning application over rapid feature additions
