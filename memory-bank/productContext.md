# Product Context: ClipShare

## Purpose & Problem Statement
ClipShare addresses the common challenge of transferring text content between different devices or sharing it with others. Traditional methods of transferring text between devices often involve:

- Sending emails to yourself
- Using messaging apps
- Creating temporary documents
- Using third-party note or sharing services
- Manual typing of content seen on another screen

All of these approaches have friction points that slow down workflows and interrupt productivity. ClipShare eliminates these friction points by providing seamless, real-time clipboard synchronization.

## Target Users
ClipShare is designed for:

1. **Individuals using multiple devices** who need to frequently transfer text between them
2. **Teams collaborating in real-time** who need to share snippets of text quickly
3. **Developers and content creators** who need to move code, URLs, or text between environments
4. **Presenters and educators** who want to share content with an audience without complicated setup

## User Experience Goals

### Simplicity
- Minimal setup and configuration required
- No user accounts needed
- Simple session creation and joining
- Clear, intuitive interface

### Reliability
- Consistent real-time synchronization
- Clear status indicators
- Minimal latency between copying and syncing

### Security
- Session-based isolation of content
- Passphrase protection for sessions
- No persistence of sensitive data
